To create an API that analyzes and recommends energy-saving optimizations based on real-time consumption data, we'll use the Python Flask framework for simplicity. The API will allow users to submit energy consumption data for analysis and receive optimization recommendations. We'll include comments and error handling to make the code understandable and robust.

Here's a basic structure for the "Energy-Optimizer-API":

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import random
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Simulated database of pre-existing energy recommendations
ENERGY_RECOMMENDATIONS = {
    "residential": [
        "Install energy-efficient LED bulbs",
        "Use smart thermostats",
        "Insulate your home to reduce heating costs",
        "Turn off appliances when not in use"
    ],
    "commercial": [
        "Upgrade to energy-efficient HVAC systems",
        "Implement automated lighting control",
        "Conduct regular energy audits",
        "Use renewable energy sources like solar panels"
    ]
}

def analyze_consumption_data(consumption_data):
    """
    Analyzes the consumption data to determine energy-saving recommendations.
    
    :param consumption_data: dict - Contains keys like 'building_type', 'consumption', etc.
    :return: dict - Contains recommendations based on the building type.
    """
    building_type = consumption_data.get('building_type', 'residential')

    # Error handling for unsupported building types
    if building_type not in ENERGY_RECOMMENDATIONS:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported building type")

    # Simulate analysis by selecting random recommendations.
    recommendations = random.sample(ENERGY_RECOMMENDATIONS[building_type], 2)

    return {
        "building_type": building_type,
        "recommendations": recommendations
    }

@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze():
    """
    Endpoint to accept energy consumption data and return recommendations.
    """
    try:
        # Parse request data
        consumption_data = request.json

        # Validate the presence of necessary data
        if not consumption_data:
            return jsonify({"error": "No data provided"}), 400
        
        logging.info(f"Received data: {consumption_data}")

        # Analyze the consumption data
        result = analyze_consumption_data(consumption_data)

        # Return the analysis result
        return jsonify(result), 200
    except ValueError as e:
        # Handle issues due to unsupported building types
        logging.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 400
    except Exception as e:
        # General error handler
        logging.error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({"error": "An unexpected error occurred"}), 500

@app.route('/')
def home():
    """Simple endpoint to verify the API is running."""
    return "Energy Optimizer API is running", 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the Flask app
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Components Explained:

1. **Flask Framework**: We use Flask to set up the API, define routes, and handle HTTP requests.
   
2. **Logging**: Basic logging is set up to capture information and errors, which helps in debugging and monitoring.

3. **Data Analysis Simulation**: We simulate energy data analysis by randomly choosing recommendations from a predefined list. This could be replaced by a more sophisticated analysis using machine learning models or other techniques.

4. **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling, such as checking for unsupported building types, missing data, and general exceptions. This makes the API more resilient in the face of unexpected input or errors. 

5. **Endpoints**:
   - `/analyze`: Accepts POST requests with consumption data and returns optimization recommendations.
   - `/`: A simple route to check if the API is running.

This program provides a foundation for developing more complex energy optimization analysis based on real-time data. In a production scenario, you might integrate it with a database and real-time data streams.
